  <h1>Project Description: Building a University Network in Cisco Packet Tracer using OSPF Protocol</h1>

  <h2>Project Goals</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Network Design: Designing a scalable and efficient network infrastructure for a university, considering factors such as network topology, device placement, and connectivity requirements.</li>
    <li>Cisco Packet Tracer: Utilizing Cisco Packet Tracer, a network simulation tool, to create a virtual environment that emulates the university network.</li>
    <li>OSPF Implementation<: Configuring the OSPF routing protocol across the network to enable dynamic routing and ensure optimal communication between network devices./li>
    <li>Network Security: Implementing basic security measures, such as access control lists (ACLs) and firewall rules, to protect the university network from unauthorized access or malicious activities.</li>
    <li>Network Services: Integrating essential network services, including DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), DNS (Domain Name System), and NAT (Network Address Translation), to facilitate network connectivity and services for the university users.</li>
    <li>Network Monitoring and Management: Setting up network monitoring tools, such as SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) and Syslog, to monitor network performance, identify issues, and ensure efficient management of the university network.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Project Tasks</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Network Planning: Analyzing the requirements and designing the network topology for the university network, considering factors like the number of buildings, departments, and the expected user load.</li>
    <li>Device Configuration : Configuring Cisco network devices, including routers, switches, and access points, with appropriate IP addresses, interfaces, and OSPF settings.</li>
    <li>OSPF Configuration:  Implementing OSPF routing protocol on the network devices to enable dynamic routing and ensure the shortest path for data transmission.</li>
    <li>Security Implementation: Implementing security measures, such as access control lists (ACLs) and firewall rules, to protect the university network from unauthorized access and potential security threats.</li>
    <li>Network Services Configuration: Setting up essential network services like DHCP, DNS, and NAT to provide network connectivity and services to university users.</li>
    <li>Network Monitoring and Management Setup: Configuring network monitoring tools, such as SNMP and Syslog, to monitor the network health, track network performance, and proactively manage any network issues.</li>
    <li>Testing and Documentation: Conducting comprehensive testing of the network setup, documenting the network design, configurations, and procedures for future reference, and creating network diagrams to visualize the university network.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>A fully functional university network simulation in Cisco Packet Tracer</li>
    <li>Comprehensive documentation</li>
    <li>Network Diagrams</li>
    <li>Practical experience and understanding</li>
    <li>Improved skills</li>
  </ol>
